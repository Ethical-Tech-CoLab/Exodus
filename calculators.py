# ─── ERCF Risk Score Formula ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# risk_score = D1×0.25 + D2×0.15 + D3×0.15 + D4×0.15 + D5×0.15 + D6×0.10 + D7×0.05
#
# All values are on a 1–5 scale; score range is [1.0, 5.0].
#
# HARD TRIGGER: if D1 ≥ 4.5 AND D6 ≥ 4.5 → score floored to max(score, 4.21) → Level 4.
#
# LEVEL THRESHOLDS:
#   Level 0  Baseline / Monitoring    : score ≤ 1.5
#   Level 1  Low Risk / Advisory      : 1.5 < score ≤ 2.5
#   Level 2  Moderate Risk / Watchful : 2.5 < score ≤ 3.5

#
# ─── WEIGHT RATIONALE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# VALIDATION STATUS: ALL WEIGHTS ARE MODELLED ESTIMATES.
# No published IHL or humanitarian operations framework specifies explicit
# numerical weights for these dimensions. Validation against an expert panel
# or empirical conflict data corpus is required before operational use.
#
# D1 Kinetic Threat (0.25 — highest):
#   Direct physical threat to life is the primary driver of evacuation necessity.
#   AP I Art. 57–58 precautionary measures are triggered first by active attack risk.
#   This dimension alone determines whether movement is physically safe.
#   Source: AP I Art. 57–58; GC IV Art. 49. ESTIMATED.
#
# D2 Vulnerability / Mobility Constraints (0.15):
#   Mobility constraints determine whether evacuation is physically possible.
#   High D2 forces medical vehicle allocation and slows the entire operation.
#   Operationally equivalent in importance to D3 logistics and D4 authorization.
#   Source: ICRC guidance on protection of persons with disabilities; Sphere 2018. ESTIMATED.
#
# D3 Authorization / Political (0.15):
#   Without consent from all armed parties, evacuation is illegal under IHL and
#   operationally blocked (GC IV Art. 49). Capped at 0.15 (not higher) because the
#   hard trigger and decision text already capture the most extreme authorization failures.
#   Source: GC IV Art. 49; ICRC Humanitarian Access in Armed Conflict (2011). ESTIMATED.
#
# D4 Logistics (0.15):
#   Even where safe and authorized, evacuation fails without road access, vehicles,
#   and fuel. Logistics collapse is empirically the leading cause of delayed evacuations
#   (Mosul 2016, Aleppo 2016).
#   Source: WFP Logistics Cluster field data; NATO NEO doctrine. ESTIMATED.
#
# D5 Destination (0.15):
#   Moving civilians to an unsafe destination creates secondary harm violating
#   non-refoulement. Srebrenica (1995) is the canonical case: evacuation to a nominally
#   safe zone became a site of genocide.
#   Source: IHL non-refoulement principle; UNHCR protection guidance. ESTIMATED.
#
# D6 Urgency (0.10 — below equal group):
#   Urgency compresses timelines but is largely subsumed by D1 in extreme scenarios.
#   The hard trigger (D1+D6 ≥ 4.5) and evacuation window indicator capture urgency
#   non-linearly; the linear weight is intentionally modest.
#   Source: NATO NEO doctrine (72h window); AP I Art. 57(2)(c). ESTIMATED.
#
# D7 Information (0.05 — lowest):
#   Information gaps increase coordination cost and panic risk, but communications
#   failure alone does not determine whether evacuation is necessary or possible.
#   Physical threat and logistics dominate over information environment.
#   Source: OCHA INFORM methodology; ICRC comms in emergencies guidance. ESTIMATED.

    """
    Determine whether the planned start month falls within the seasonal closure
    period for the given terrain type and latitude zone, and return an adjusted
    terrain multiplier plus operational flags.

    METHODOLOGY (estimated — see TERRAIN_MULT comment block above for sourcing):
    Closure periods are determined by latitude zone and terrain type:
    - Lat > 30 (temperate/sub-arctic northern): snow closure = Dec, Jan, Feb, Mar (months 12,1,2,3)
    - Lat < -30 (temperate southern hemisphere): snow closure = Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep (months 6,7,8,9)
    - Lat -30 to 30 (tropical/subtropical): wet season closure = Apr–Oct (months 4–10)
      (broad regional approximation; two-season equatorial zones not individually modelled)

    Terrain types 4–5 have no seasonal adjustment (minimal/no documented closure).
    Terrain type 1 in closure period is flagged 'potentially_impassable' rather than
    just receiving a cost boost — consistent with documented cases such as Afghanistan's
    Salang Pass (closure Nov–Apr, WFP documented rerouting).

    Seasonal boost factors are estimated with no primary numerical source; they represent
    the additional cost of operating on a partially passable route vs. a fully open one.
    The 'potentially_impassable' flag for terrain 1 is the operationally preferred signal.

    Args:
        terrain: terrain level 1–5 (matches TERRAIN_MULT keys)
        lat: latitude of conflict location (from map pins)
        month: month of planned start date (1=Jan … 12=Dec)

    Returns dict with:

        base_mult            — unadjusted TERRAIN_MULT value
        seasonal_boost       — fractional boost applied (0.0 if not in closure)

    ===============================================
    Inputs: population P, vulnerable fraction V (as %), risk level R (0–4), distance D km.

    PLANNING BASIS — POPULATION SIZING:
    Supplies and personnel are dimensioned for the total population at risk (P), consistent
    with humanitarian planning doctrine:
    - Sphere Handbook (2018): minimum standards apply to the full disaster-affected population,
      not only those who accept assistance. Planning figures use total population in need (PIN).
      URL: spherestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/Sphere-Handbook-2018-EN.pdf
    - IASC Caseload Support Package (2016): response plans project needs for the full PIN;
      actual beneficiaries reached will be lower but planning must cover the total.
      URL: gbvaor.net/sites/default/files/2019-07/2016 IASC caseload support package (EN).pdf

    IN-SITU POPULATION NOTE:
    NRC "Considerations for Planning Mass Evacuations of Civilians in Conflict Settings" (2017)
    explicitly warns that convoy supplies must NOT be drawn from in-situ population resources:
    "If a food warehouse is emptied to provide food for an evacuating convoy, the population
    that would have otherwise benefited from those supplies may feel that humanitarians are
    offering preferential treatment." The in-situ assistance stream is modelled separately
    in calculate_remaining_costs().
    URL: nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/reports/considerations-for-planning-mass-evacuations-of-civilians-in-conflict-settings

    FIXED vs VARIABLE COST DISTINCTION — GAP:
    No published institutional source (WFP, UNHCR, IOM, ICRC) explicitly documents a
    fixed mobilization cost (scaled to total population) vs variable execution cost (scaled
    to actual evacuees) for conflict evacuation operations. Academic ops research literature
    (MDPI, 2025) models fixed+variable costs mathematically but for casualty evacuation,
    not civilian humanitarian operations. BVL (2020) confirms logistics experts decline to
    give generic figures due to context variability.

#
# FORMULA:  base_prob = 1 − exp(−RATE × days)  [exponential saturation]
#           prob = clamp( base_prob + D3_correction, D6_floor, 0.95 )
#
# CALIBRATION from 10 historical cases in historical_data.py:
# Rate k derived by: k = −ln(1 − p_observed) / days_to_outcome
#
# L4 anchors (k averaged from 2 non-outlier cases):
#   Mariupol 2022 (L4/86d/81% displaced):  k = −ln(0.19)/86  = 0.0193
#     → siege warfare, failed corridors, D3=1.5, D6=5.0
#   Aleppo 2016   (L4/100d/90% evacuated): k = −ln(0.10)/100 = 0.0230
#     → brokered green buses at day 100, D3=2.0, D6=5.0
#   Sudan 2023    (L4/400d/~100%):         k ≈ 0.012 → excluded (spontaneous
#     displacement without corridors; D6=5 floor already captures urgency)
#   Srebrenica    (L4/3d/100%):            OUTLIER — genocide in 3 days; the
#     D6=5 urgency floor (0.85) captures this correctly without distorting the rate
#   Gaza 2023     (L4/420d/83%):           Internal displacement only; treated
#     as D6=5 floor case since organized external extraction never opened
#   → L4 BASE RATE = mean(0.0193, 0.0230) = 0.021
#
# L3 anchors (k averaged from 3 cases where D6 floor does not dominate):
#   Mosul 2016–17 (L3/270d/90% displaced): k = −ln(0.10)/270 = 0.0085
#     → pre-staged IDP camps, prolonged organized extraction, D3=3.0, D6=4.0
#   DRC/Goma 2024 (L3/180d/80% displaced): k = −ln(0.20)/180 = 0.0089
#     → M23 advance, spontaneous displacement, D3=2.0, D6=4.5
#   CAR 2014      (L3/180d/88% displaced): k = −ln(0.12)/180 = 0.0118
#     → convoy attacks, partial corridors, D3=2.5, D6=4.0
#   Kherson 2022  (L3/45d/75% displaced):  k = 0.031 → EXCLUDED as anchor:
#     largely voluntary departure via railway; D6=4.0 floor dominates at 45d
#   Kosovo 1999   (L3/78d/100%):           EXCLUDED: ethnic cleansing outlier,
#     D6=5 floor captures the urgency
#   → L3 BASE RATE = mean(0.0085, 0.0089, 0.0118) = 0.010
#
# L2/L1 BASE RATES: no direct historical cases at these levels in the dataset.
#   L2 = 0.005 (half of L3 — proportional scaling)
#   L1 = 0.002 (further halved — low-intensity, slow-onset)
#   L0 = 0.000 (no conflict, no extraction)
#
# MAXIMUM BASE PROBABILITY (before D3/D6 modifiers):
#   L4 = 0.95 — all L4 cases converge to near-total displacement
#   L3 = 0.80 — Mosul (90%) and DRC (80%) observed; base capped here,
#               D3 modifier brings it to 0.85-0.90 for high-threat authorizations
#   L2 = 0.60 — interpolated; no direct cases
#   L1 = 0.30 — interpolated; most civilians can self-manage at this level
#   L0 = 0.00
#
# UNVALIDATED: L2 and L1 rates have no empirical anchors. They require data
#   from monitored L2 conflicts (e.g., OCHA-monitored low-intensity NIAC)
#   to validate. Current values are structurally plausible interpolations only.

# Emergency extraction rate: estimated 1-8% of remaining population requiring urgent
# medical evacuation (critical casualties unable to self-evacuate). Based on conflict
# casualty ratios (ICRC surgical data) — not mass evacuation rate. Revised from the prior
# 10-95% range, which conflated "probability of a mass extraction operation" with "fraction
# of the population needing individual medevac" — UNHAS 2022 data shows only ~0.25% of all
# passengers transported required medical/security evacuation, two orders of magnitude below
# the prior calibration even accounting for a higher-need trapped-population context.

#             Source: WFP Gaza ceasefire ~2% loss rate under active monitoring.
#
# L1 = 1.5   SUPPORTED.
#             Sources: WFP Red Sea maritime rerouting +18% (1.18×); WFP Sudan
#             logistics 1.23×. Value 1.5× is a conservative ceiling.
#
# L2 = 2.0   PARTIALLY VALIDATED.  [Prior: 3.0]
#             Documented: logistics premium (1.23×) + partial escort overhead = 1.5–2.0×.
#             Set at 2.0× (upper bound of documented range). Gap to prior 3.0×: ~1.0×
#             in unquantified security overhead, hazard pay, rerouting. Ideal source:
#             UNDSS escort cost data by conflict intensity (not publicly indexed).
#
# L3 = 3.6   PARTIALLY VALIDATED.  [Prior: 5.0]
#             Documented: Somalia security (~$400M/year ≈ 50% of ops, 2017) + Yemen armed
#             escort ($3K/convoy, Sana'a Center ~2020) combined reach 2.5–3.6×. Set at
#             3.6× (upper bound). Gap to prior 5.0×: ~1.4× in hazard pay and negotiation
#             overhead (plausible, unmeasured). Ideal source: ICRC internal cost reports.
#
# L4 = 4.0   DIRECTIONALLY PLAUSIBLE, UNCONFIRMED.  [Prior: 8.0]
#             No single public document exceeds ~4× from documented components.
#             Frontline Gaza/Sudan operations likely higher but no public figure found.
#             Set at 4.0× pending validation. This is a known gap in published
#             humanitarian logistics literature — cost data at this level appears to be
#             internal to UNDSS and ICRC.
#
# RESEARCH NOTE: The absence of a single published cost multiplier for active-conflict
# humanitarian delivery represents a genuine gap in the humanitarian logistics literature.
# This model may be among the first to attempt explicit quantification. Full validation
# requires direct data access from UNDSS, ICRC, or WFP internal operational reports.

# ─── ERCF MORTALITY MODEL v2 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Empirically-derived with dimensional modulation.
# Replaces the fixed-rate-by-level approach in Mortality Model v1.
#
# BASE RATES — derived from 10 historical cases (1995–2024), excluding outliers:
#   Srebrenica 1995 — targeted genocide (0.003× ratio) — outside model scope
#   Sudan 2023     — dispersed conflict at continental scale — outside model scope
#
#   Observed rates, applying progressive displacement correction:
#     L4 siege (Mariupol, Aleppo): mean effective ≈ 4.0/10K/d
#     L4 non-siege (Gaza):         effective ≈ (included in L4 base + conf modifier)
#     L3 organized displacement:   mean ≈ 1.5/10K/d
#     L3 prolonged/dispersed:      mean ≈ 0.6/10K/d
#   Base rates represent the median across usable cases; confinement modifier
#   then differentiates siege from open-corridor conditions within each level.
#
# CONFINEMENT MODIFIER — D3 × D4 interaction:
#   confinement_score = (D3_authorization − 1) × D4_logistics / 5
#   D3 runs the same direction as the other dimensions: 1 = full consent from all
#   parties, 5 = active refusal / no valid authorization (see the D3 scale criteria in
#   static/index.html). Confinement therefore rises with D3, not with (5 − D3).
#   Range: 0 (full corridor, unblocked logistics) → 4 (full siege, blocked logistics)
#   Multipliers: ≤1→×0.5, ≤2→×1.0, ≤3→×2.0, ≤4→×4.0, >4→×8.0
#   Empirical anchors (d3 values as stored in historical_data.py, same scale):
#     Aleppo  (d3=4.0, d4=4.0): score=2.40 → ×2.0 (near-siege, high mortality ✓)
#     Kosovo  (d3=4.0, d4=3.5): score=2.10 → ×2.0 (forced displacement ✓)
#     Kherson (d3=2.5, d4=3.0): score=0.90 → ×0.5 (organized, open corridor ✓)
#     Mosul   (d3=3.0, d4=3.5): score=1.40 → ×1.0 (structured military op ✓)
#
# DISPLACEMENT PROTECTION FACTOR:
#   protection_factor = (1 − remaining_pct) × 0.6
#   Where remaining_pct = fraction of population still in conflict zone.
#   0.6 coefficient: not full protection because displaced populations still face
#   risks during movement (under fire, checkpoints, exposure); empirically derived
#   from Mariupol (factor ≈ 0.49 → corrected ratio 2.7× vs recorded 4.6× uncorrected).
#
# KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
#   - Small sample (n=10 cases, 8 usable for calibration)
#   - Confinement multiplier thresholds are stepwise, not continuous
#   - Protection factor is linear — does not model non-linear evacuation timing
#   - Does not distinguish targeted killing from incidental conflict mortality
#   - Gaza remains poorly calibrated: displaced population still under L4 conditions
#   - Sudan remains outside model scope: 400d × 6M population × L4 exceeds design range
#
# RECOMMENDED CITATION:
#   "ERCF Mortality Model v2, derived from ERCF Historical Case Database
#    (1995–2024), 10 conflict cases, v2 calibration June 2026."
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# NOTE: DEATH_RATE_10K (v1 mortality rates [0.3, 0.5, 1.5, 4.0, 10.0]) was removed —
# dead code, zero references despite the prior comment claiming it was used by
# calculate_remaining_costs() (that function doesn't compute mortality at all; it uses
# calculate_injuries()/INJURY_RATE_10K for the injury-cost component). Superseded by
# DEATH_RATE_10K_EMPIRICAL (v2+, below) since v2 — the comment describing this constant
# as still in use was itself stale. Prior MORTALITY_RATE_1K [0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 3.0, 15.0]
# per 1K was 7–69× above observed values (Mariupol L4 actual: 0.216/1K/day; Gaza L4
# actual: 0.047/1K/day) — kept here only as a historical note.

# Empirical base rates (v2→v5): derived from 10 historical cases, excluding outliers.
# Lower than WHO theoretical rates because real populations partially evacuate,
# reducing cumulative exposure. Confinement modifier (×0.5–×8) then modulates
# the effective rate based on D3/D4 interaction.
# v7 calibration: differential_evolution on 16 in-scope cases, MSLE=0.8051.
# Prior v5 rates [0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 6.0, 4.0] computed against stale stored model_deaths.
# L3>L4 ordering empirically validated: L3 cases (urban siege, city conflict) show
# higher observed per-capita rates than L4 cases dominated by large-enclave operations.
# Sources: ERCF Historical Case Database (29 cases, 1991–2024); calibration/full_calibration.py
DEATH_RATE_10K_EMPIRICAL = [0.777, 0.964, 3.625, 1.805, 1.000]  # v7 calibration — 16 cases, R²=0.855, LOOCV=0.807, 7/16 within 2× (44%). Optimised via differential_evolution minimising MSLE. L3>L4 empirically validated.

# ─── ERCF MORTALITY MODEL v3 — Geographic Exposure Factor ────────────────────
#
# Analysis of 10 historical cases shows mortality errors cluster by conflict type:
#   Urban siege (Mariupol, Aleppo, Srebrenica): entire population under direct fire
#   Enclave/blockade (Gaza): confined but not all under direct fire simultaneously
#   City-scale conflict (Mosul, Kherson, Kosovo): frontline moves through city parts
#   Regional/dispersed (Sudan, CAR, DRC): conflict across large area, scattered pop.
#
# exposure_factor represents the fraction of population_at_risk simultaneously
# exposed to lethal conditions. Applied as a multiplier on effective_mort.
#
# FIXED TYPES (pre-classified historical cases and user selection):
CONFLICT_TYPE_EXPOSURE = {
    'urban_siege':   0.85,  # Mariupol, Aleppo, Srebrenica — entire city under fire
    'enclave':       0.65,  # Gaza — confined but partial direct exposure
    'city_conflict': 0.40,  # Mosul, Kherson, Kosovo — frontline moves through city
    'regional':      0.12,  # Sudan, CAR, DRC — large area, scattered exposure
}
#
# AUTO MODE (scenario builder, no pre-classification):
#   exposure_score = d1_kinetic / max(1, log10(population / 10000))
#   exposure_factor = clamp(exposure_score / 5, 0.05, 1.0)
#   Higher D1 → more direct fire; larger population → more dispersed → lower per-capita exposure.
#   Effective threshold: populations > 100k start seeing dispersion reduction.
#   Verified against historical cases:
#     Mariupol  D1=5 pop=430k  → factor≈0.61 (siege ✓)
#     Gaza      D1=5 pop=2.3M  → factor≈0.42 (enclave ✓)
#     Sudan     D1=5 pop=6M    → factor≈0.36 (regional ✓)
#     Kosovo    D1=4.5 pop=850k → factor≈0.47 (city ✓)

#   New: pop_ratio = max(1, log10(pop/10000)^1.4)   ← steeper decay
#   Rationale: Original log10 denominator saturated at ~2.8 for 6M people (Sudan),
#   giving auto_EF ~0.36 when ~0.12–0.19 was needed for continental-scale conflict.
#   Exponent 1.4 steepens falloff so large dispersed populations get lower exposure:
#     Kherson  80k:  denom 1.0^1.4=1.00  → EF unchanged (~0.80)
#     Mosul    1M:   denom 2.0^1.4=2.64  → EF 0.45 → 0.34
#     DRC      1.5M: denom 2.18^1.4=3.18 → EF 0.41 → 0.25
#     Sudan    6M:   denom 2.78^1.4=4.15 → EF 0.36 → 0.19
#
# IMPROVEMENT 2 — Siege protection cap
#   Old: protection_factor = (1 − remaining_pct) × 0.60  (universal)
#   New: protection_factor = (1 − remaining_pct) × 0.30  (if D3 ≥ 4 AND D1 ≥ 4)
#   Rationale: The 0.60 coefficient assumes displacement = safety. In urban sieges
#   (no authorized corridor + active direct fire), movement itself carries high
#   mortality risk — evacuees passed checkpoints under fire, buses were attacked.
#   The 0.30 cap means displacement is still protective (better than staying)
#   but only half as protective as in an open-corridor scenario.
#   Siege condition: D3_authorization ≥ 4.0 AND D1_kinetic ≥ 4.0.
#   Affected cases: Mariupol, Gaza, Aleppo, Kosovo, Sudan

    ERCF MORTALITY MODEL — SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
    =============================================

    INTENDED USE: Prospective operational planning for evacuation decisions
    in scenarios of 0-90 days duration where D1-D7 dimensions are assessed
    in real time. The model estimates the human cost of inaction to support
    the decision of whether and when to evacuate.

    CALIBRATION RESULTS (10 historical cases, 1995-2024):
    - Auto mode: 2/10 cases within 2× of recorded deaths (Kherson, Mosul)
    - Named mode: 2/10 cases within 2× (Mosul, DRC-Goma)
    - Combined: 3 unique cases within 2× across both modes

    CASES OUTSIDE MODEL SCOPE:
    1. Srebrenica 1995: mass execution in 3 days. Model framework assumes
       conflict attrition over time. Genocide dynamics not modeled.
    2. Sudan 2023: conflict dispersed across >500,000 km². Population at
       risk (6M) is regional, not locally concentrated. Model overestimates
       by 24× in auto mode.
    3. Gaza 2023: mortality driven significantly by famine and healthcare
       collapse, not direct violence alone. D1-D7 do not capture blockade-
       induced disease/starvation mortality.

    STRUCTURAL LIMITATIONS:
    - Model applies rates to population at risk assuming linear exposure.
      Real conflicts have non-uniform exposure across population.
    - Displacement assumed to reduce exposure linearly. In sieges,
      displacement movement itself carries mortality risk.
    - No disease/famine/healthcare collapse component. Conflicts with
      prolonged blockade will be underestimated.
    - Small calibration sample (n=10). Confidence intervals not computed.

    FORMULA DOCUMENTATION — calculate_remaining_costs()
    ====================================================
    Models the operational cost of delivering humanitarian assistance to a civilian
    population that chose to remain in an active conflict zone instead of evacuating.
    Distinct from calculate_staying_costs(), which tracks humanitarian impact over time;
    this function tracks the *provider-side cost* of keeping that population alive.

    # In-situ assistance treated as parallel operation to evacuation convoy, consistent with
    # NRC 'Considerations for Planning Mass Evacuations of Civilians in Conflict Settings'
    # (2017/2023): population remaining behind receives protection and assistance as a
    # separate logistical stream, not subtracted from convoy supplies.

    COMPONENT 2 — Emergency extraction (probability-weighted, critical-medevac need)
      Anchored to UNHAS_RATE_USD_PER_KM = $2.08/passenger-km (2023)

                        = extraction_base          otherwise

      Recalibrated (this session) from a prior 10-95% probability range (linear ramp,
      `min(days/30 × risk_level × 0.1, 0.95)`) down to 1-8%. The prior range conflated
      "probability of a mass extraction operation covering the whole remaining population"
      with "fraction of the population needing individual critical medevac" — UNHAS 2022
      data shows only ~0.25% of all passengers transported required medical/security
      evacuation, roughly two orders of magnitude below the prior calibration even
      accounting for a higher-need trapped-population context. See RC_EXTR_BASE_RATE /
      RC_EXTR_MAX_PROB definitions above for the full rationale.

      FLAG: actual distance should use the distance_km input parameter, not a
      fixed value. Call sites must pass the scenario's distance_km to get
      context-specific extraction costs. The 50km default is a conservative
      short-range estimate; real conflict extraction distances vary from 20km
      (urban corridor) to 300km+ (regional hub transfer).

      vulnerable_premium = vuln × days × VULNERABLE_DAILY_PREMIUM_USD ($2.50/person/day)
      Reflects mobility assistance, extra medical supplies, and mental health support for
      vulnerable individuals, on top of (not instead of) the $3.50/day baseline already
      counted for every remaining person inside COMPONENT 1. `vuln` here already reflects
      differential retention — vulnerable individuals are estimated ~2× less likely to
      evacuate than the general population (ref: AARP/FEMA Post-Katrina Look Back 2006;
      WHO Disability, Disaster Risk Reduction and Emergency Preparedness 2005).

    KNOWN LIMITATIONS
      • Access multipliers and loss rates are regional averages, not country-specific.
      • Extraction probability is a simple linear ramp — real probability depends on
        corridor availability, party cooperation, and seasonal factors.
      • Helicopter premium (L4) assumes all non-ground routes; may overstate cost if
        partial ground corridors remain open.

    VALIDATION STATUS — derived from analysis of 10 historical cases in the project
    (historical_data.py: Mariupol, Gaza, Srebrenica, Aleppo, Kherson, Mosul,
     Kosovo, CAR, Sudan, DRC/Goma) conducted June 2026.
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    PARAMETERS WITH QUALITATIVE SUPPORT FROM HISTORICAL CASES
    (not derived numerically — historical data contains no dollar cost figures)

      extraction_probability formula — SUPERSEDED NOTE (this session's recalibration):
        The qualitative support below (Mariupol/Aleppo/Kherson corridor-failure timelines)
        was derived for the PRIOR linear formula, which modeled "probability that a mass
        extraction operation covering the whole remaining population occurs" and saturated
        near-certainty (95%) over weeks-to-months. The current exponential formula
        (RC_EXTR_BASE_RATE / RC_EXTR_MAX_PROB, 1-8% ceiling) models a different quantity —
        the fraction of the population needing individual critical medevac — and reaches
        its (much lower) ceiling within the first few days regardless of case duration, so
        the case-specific day-threshold reasoning below no longer applies to this parameter.
        The historical case anchors themselves remain valid evidence for corridor-failure
        *timing* in general; they have not yet been re-validated against the recalibrated
        1-8% critical-medevac-rate parameter specifically. Flagged for future work.
        Original (pre-recalibration) qualitative narrative, kept for reference:
        All 5 Level-4 cases show structural access denial by ~86–100 days (Mariupol siege,
        Aleppo corridor failure). Kherson (L3/45d): 75% was eventually displaced.

      Difficulty is dominated by CONSENT, not DURATION:
        Historical cases show Mosul (L3/270 days, pre-staged IDP camps) had lower
        per-day mortality than Kosovo (L3/78 days, sudden displacement overwhelmed
        capacity). CAR (L3/180 days, convoy attacks) had 6× higher per-day
        mortality than DRC (L3/180 days, secondary displacement) at identical
        duration and risk level. This means a duration-based multiplier alone is
        insufficient without a consent/corridor-availability modifier. No such
        modifier is currently implemented — flagged for future work.

      Level-4 is categorically different from Level-3 in kind, not degree:
        Every L4 case in the dataset shows complete corridor failure (Mariupol,
        Gaza, Sudan) or extraction only via exceptional political brokering after
        years of effort (Aleppo: Russia/Turkey brokered green buses). The
        extraction formula's 2.5× helicopter premium for L4 reflects this
        categorical difference but is not numerically derived from case data.

    PARAMETERS THAT REMAIN UNVALIDATED — web search results (June 2026)
    ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

      extraction_ground_usd_per_person  [$800]
        WEB SEARCH RESULT (June 2026):
          Source: WFP Executive Board "Update on UNHAS", January 2025
          URL: https://executiveboard.wfp.org/document_download/WFP-0000165597
          CONFIRMED: UNHAS operational cost per passenger-km = $1.86 (2022),
                     $2.08 (2023), $1.98 (2024).
          Derivation: At 2× ad hoc premium over scheduled rate, 200 km extraction
          distance: $2.08 × 2 × 200 = $832/person. The $800 value is consistent
          with a ~190 km midpoint extraction with 2× ad hoc surcharge.
          Plausible range from UNHAS data: $400 (100 km) to $1,250 (300 km).
          STATUS: CALIBRATED — UNHAS confirms $800 is a defensible central
          estimate. Specific conflict-zone extraction distances for Mariupol,
          Aleppo, or Mosul were not found to set a more precise figure.

      extraction_medical_evac_usd_per_person  [$2500]
        WEB SEARCH RESULT (June 2026):
          Same UNHAS source as above ($2.08/km in 2023).
          Derivation: Medevac carries 2–3 patients vs. 15–19 on a standard
          flight (capacity factor 5–7×). At 5× capacity, 200 km: $2.08×5×200 =
          $2,080. At 4× capacity, 300 km: $2.08×4×300 = $2,496.
          The $2,500 value sits at the high end of the plausible UNHAS-derived
          range ($1,040–$2,500). A 200 km medevac at 4× capacity yields ~$1,664.
          PROPOSED REVISION: $1,800 (200 km, 4× capacity, 2023 rate), with
          $2,500 retained as the upper-bound/high-intensity estimate.
          STATUS: PARTIALLY CALIBRATED — no published cost-per-medevac figure
          found in ICRC or WHO public documents. ICRC care is free at point of
          delivery; no billing data is publicly available (ICRC Annual Reports
          2022–2023 confirmed only total budget, not per-case cost).

      extraction_helicopter_premium_multiplier  [2.5]
        WEB SEARCH RESULT (June 2026):
          UNHAS does not publish separate per-passenger-km rates for helicopter
          vs. fixed-wing in public Executive Board documents. The fleet-wide
          average ($2.08/km) includes both. No separate helicopter-specific
          rate found.
          STATUS: UNVALIDATED — the 2.5× value cannot be confirmed or refuted
          from any publicly accessible UNHAS document. The UNHAS 2022 Annual
          Review notes helicopter replacement cost $3.3M–$6.5M/month extra,
          indicating helicopters are significantly more expensive than fixed-wing
          at the fleet level, consistent with a >1× premium, but the exact
          multiplier is not derivable from public data.
          Recommended next step: contact WFP Aviation Service directly for
          disaggregated helicopter rate cards (available per-country on request).

      RC_ACCESS_MULT  [1.0, 1.5, 3.0, 5.0, 8.0]
        Each multiplier is the SUM of two components with different validation status:

        ── COMPONENT A: logistics_component (WFP-validated) ──────────────────
          What it covers: transport, warehousing, handling, rerouting due to
          access constraints.
          WFP data (June 2026 web search):
            Eastern Africa mixed average (2023): $170.71/MT total, $131.43/MT
            transport. URL: https://wfp.tind.io/record/130347/files/ELR%203284.pdf
            Sudan active conflict (2023): $209.63/MT
            → conflict premium = $209.63/$170.71 = 1.23×
          Range supported by WFP data: 1.0× (stable) to ~1.23× (active conflict)
          STATUS: PARTIALLY VALIDATED for the logistics component only.

        ── COMPONENT B: security_and_overhead_component (unvalidated) ────────
          What it covers: armed escort hire, humanitarian negotiation staff,
          hazard pay, route-intelligence gathering, vehicle hardening, convoy
          protection surcharges, forced corridor rerouting overhead.
          Estimated range: 2× to 7× above the logistics component alone.
          STATUS: UNVALIDATED — requires UNDSS security cost data or ICRC
          operational security cost reporting. No public source found.

        ── TOTAL MULTIPLIER = A + B ───────────────────────────────────────────
          L0: 1.0 = 1.0 logistics + 0 overhead   (no conflict)
          L1: 1.5 = 1.0–1.1 logistics + ~0.4 overhead
          L2: 3.0 = 1.2 logistics + ~1.8 overhead
          L3: 5.0 = 1.2 logistics + ~3.8 overhead
          L4: 8.0 = 1.2 logistics + ~6.8 overhead
          Note: logistics component does not grow beyond ~1.2× because WFP
          data shows active conflict logistics cost only modestly above regional
          average. The dramatic multiplier growth is entirely in the unvalidated
          security/overhead component.

        ── FIVE-SOURCE VALIDATION SEARCH — June 2026 ─────────────────────────

            Derivation: if security = 50% of total, adding security to logistics
                        baseline: 1/0.50 = 2.0× from security alone (L3 proxy)
            Combined with WFP logistics 1.23×: ~1.23 × 2.0 = ~2.5× documented total

                               up to US$3,000, plus fuel" (UNDSS-mandated armed escort)
            Distance: Aden–Mukalla ~480 km; convoy capacity ~30–50 MT
            Escort cost per MT: $60–$100/MT (35–58% above $170/MT logistics baseline)
            Escort-only multiplier: 1.35–1.58× (armed escort alone, L3–L4 Yemen)
            Verdict: PARTIALLY SUPPORTIVE — Yemen is L3–L4 equivalent; armed escort
                     alone adds 35–58% to logistics; total security cost is higher.

                              rerouted due to Red Sea conflict (Houthi attacks, 2024–26)
            Context: maritime rerouting (Cape of Good Hope) — equivalent to L0–L1
                     access disruption. Not active-conflict ground delivery.
            Verdict: CONFIRMS L0–L1 = 1.0–1.5× range. Neutral for L2–L4.

              Finding: "per capita cost of humanitarian response shows a statistically
                        significant difference" between conflict and non-conflict contexts.
              No multiplier given. Conflict contexts excluded from non-conflict baseline.

                medical/natural disaster emergencies)
              - Supply chain share ratio: 79/65 = 1.22× higher share in armed conflict
              - Armed conflict "programme running costs" = 17% (6 pts above 11% average)
                — attributed to "access limitations due to security issues"
            Note: this is supply chain SHARE of total ops, not a multiplier vs. stable
                  non-emergency baseline.
            Verdict: PARTIALLY SUPPORTIVE — armed conflict drives higher supply chain
                     cost share than other emergency types; 1.22× within-emergency ratio.

        ── CONSOLIDATED VERDICT (June 2026) ──────────────────────────────────
          Building documented components bottom-up for each level:
          [A] = logistics premium (WFP Sudan 1.23×)
          [B] = armed escort (Yemen $3K/convoy: +35–58% of logistics = ×1.35–1.58)
          [C] = total security (Somalia proxy: security ≈ 50% of total → ×2.0)
          [D] = uncaptured: hazard pay, negotiation, rerouting overhead, compound costs

          Level  Value  Documented [A×B or A×C]  Gap to model  Verdict
          L0     1.0×   1.0× (confirmed)          0             CONFIRMED
          L1     1.5×   1.18–1.23× (WFP data)     ~0.3×         SUPPORTED
          L2     3.0×   ~1.5–2.0× [A×B partial]   ~1.0–1.5×     NOT CONFIRMED at 3×
                        Data supports ~1.5–2.5×; residual D is not measured
          L3     5.0×   ~2.5–3.6× [A×C + B]       ~1.4–2.5×     PARTIALLY SUPPORTED
                        3–4× is well-evidenced; 5× requires ~1.4× in [D]
          L4     8.0×   ~3–4× at ceiling of        ~4–5×         DIRECTIONALLY
                        documented components                      PLAUSIBLE only
                        Gaza/Sudan frontline may exceed this; no confirming figure

          KEY CAVEAT: The Somalia security figure ($400M/year) and Yemen escort
          ($3K/convoy) represent different cost categories that cannot simply be
          multiplied without risk of double-counting. The bottom-up estimate of
          ~2.5–3.6× for L3 is a rough ceiling on what can be documented; it does
          not mean L3=5× is wrong — it means ~1.4–2× in additional overhead costs
          (hazard pay, negotiation staff, evacuation contingency) are plausible but
          unmeasured by any public source found.

        ── PER-PERSON-PER-DAY CONVERSION (for documentation only) ────────────
          Converting WFP per-MT figure to per-person-per-day to compare
          against the $3.50/person/day model base:

          Assumption: 0.65 kg/person/day supply weight
            = 0.50 kg food (dry weight from Sphere 2100 kcal estimate)
            + 0.10 kg medicine/medical supplies
            + 0.05 kg other (hygiene, communication materials)
            Excludes water: Sphere standard is 15 L/day = 15 kg/day per person

          At Sudan conflict rate of $209.63/MT and 0.65 kg/person/day:
            0.00065 MT × $209.63 = $0.136/person/day (logistics only, dry goods)
            Gap vs model base: $3.50 / $0.136 = 25.7× — appears very large

          GAP EXPLANATION — why $3.50/$0.136 = 25.7× is not a contradiction:
            (1) Water dominates supply weight. At 15 kg/day water:
                total weight = 15.65 kg = 0.01565 MT/person/day
                $209.63 × 0.01565 = $3.28/person/day — within 6% of $3.50 base
            (2) The $3.50 base includes admin, staffing, distribution, monitoring.
            (3) Sudan per-MT underestimates true access cost (UNHAS/Logistics
                Cluster services provided free-to-user or at partial cost recovery).
          CONCLUSION: The $3.50 base rate is defensible when water weight is
          included. The WFP data does not contradict it.

          → This establishes a near-ceasefire floor of ~2% under active
          monitoring. The model's L0–1 rate of 5% is conservative relative to
          this (5% includes non-looting losses: spoilage, logistics wastage).
          Syria (Hall 2022 via corruption literature): estimated half of funds

          STATUS: L0–1 rate of 5% is directionally consistent with the Gaza

          FIGURES (DALY-derived, not directly published per-case costs):
            Nigeria (armed conflict, Teme Hospital): $172/DALY → ~$500/case
            Haiti (disaster, La Trinité): $223/DALY → ~$650/case
          Inflation-adjusted to 2026 (~3%/yr × 15 yrs): ~$779 and ~$1,013
          These are the most relevant proxy for MSF-level frontline trauma
          centres. The Nigeria figure most closely matches the model's context.

          FIGURE: $190 USD median patient-side (out-of-pocket) cost per trauma
          admission. Non-conflict LMIC hospital. PATIENT cost, not provider.
          This is a floor — sets minimum expectation for any LMIC trauma care.

          NO COST FIGURE. Section 2.4 "Injury and trauma care" sets clinical
          standards only. Sphere is not a costing document.

        DOCUMENTED RANGE (peer-reviewed, conflict or LMIC trauma):
          Floor (mission hospital, conflict): $211/surgical case (2022)
          Floor (patient-side, non-conflict): $190/case (2021)
          MSF conflict trauma center: ~$500–650/case (2009; ~$779–1,013 in 2026)

        STATUS: ABOVE documented peer-reviewed range.
          The $1,200 value exceeds all directly documented figures. It sits
          above even the inflation-adjusted MSF Nigeria figure (~$779/case).
          It approaches the inflation-adjusted MSF Haiti figure (~$1,013).
          $1,200 would be defensible ONLY if:
          (a) using MSF Haiti 2009 inflated to 2026 (~$1,013) AND
          (b) adding a ~20% premium for frontline L3–L4 access conditions
          NOTE: If $1,200 includes access overhead, and RC_ACCESS_MULT also
          captures access costs (for the supply component), the model may
          double-count access costs for the medical component.

        RECOMMENDATION: Reduce to $500 (upper bound of directly documented
          range, MSF Nigeria 2009 conflict trauma, not inflation-adjusted).
          Alternatively use $800 (inflation-adjusted MSF Nigeria ~$779,
          rounded up). Do not use $1,200 — this exceeds the inflation-adjusted
          ceiling of the best-documented MSF conflict trauma data.
